# Machine Learning Projects

Some just-for-fun data science and machine learning projects, mostly written in Python and GNU R. Ignore this.

There should be a README file in each project directory, so just open the directories for more information.

Note that you can just click on Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) files here on the GitHub website, and they will be displayed in your browser. :)
