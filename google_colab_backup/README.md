# google_colab_backup

This is a backup of my ipython notebooks that I use to run machine learning
projects on Google Colab.

They are not secret, but I suggest you ignore them. They will not be of much
use to the public, because they typically work on data in my private Google
Drive, so you cannot run them anyways.

If you see something along the lines of 

```python
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')

#...

data_dir = '/content/drive/My Drive/some_dir'
```

in a script, you know that it's pointless to try to run it.
